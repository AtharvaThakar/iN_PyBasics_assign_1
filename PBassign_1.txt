Q3
numeric type - integer, float, complex
text type - string
boolean type - bool 

Sequence type - this type contains list, range and tuple
This type contains multiple values of data in sequential manner.
List can have multiple elements and can be modified that is they are mutable.
Range type only contains numerical values, these give series of numbers with specified intervals.
Tuple is able to store multiple values in a single variable and these are immutable.

Mapping type - it has dict(dictionary) type 
In dictionary the values are stored in pairs like ( key : value ), duplicate values cannot be stored.
The value is accessed through the key. 

Set type - it has set type and frozenset type
Set is collection of items in a single variable which stores unique values.
Set elements are unchangeable but items can be removed or added.

Q9 
x = '9'
To get integer of x, we'll use int(), like int(x) and we'll get integer value of 9.
For floating point number, function is float(), float(x) will be 9.0.
Similarly for string, str() is used.

Q10 
The concatenation is only allowed for strings. Here 99 is integer. 
The correct expression should be 'I have eaten' + '99' + 'burritos.
